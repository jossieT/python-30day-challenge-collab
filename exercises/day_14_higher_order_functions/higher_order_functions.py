#Exercises: Level 1
#1. Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.
'''
    - map - Applies a function to each element of an iterable 
           (like a list) and returns a new iterable (like a list or map object).
           - Syntax map(function, iterable)
    - filter -Applies a condition (a function that returns True or False) and 
              keeps only the elements that meet the condition.
             - Syntax filter(condition, iterable)
    - reduce (needs import from functools) - Takes all elements and reduces them to a 
              single value by applying a function cumulatively.
             - Syntax reduce(function, iterable)-
